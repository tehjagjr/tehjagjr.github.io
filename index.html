 <h3>A comparison of the spiritual space within two Birmingham 
Cathedrals – St. Phillips and St. Chads.</h3>

<p>The city of Birmingham is the home of two Cathedrals. One, the Anglican St. Phillips, and the second, the Catholic St. Chad’s. They are located within minutes of each other in the city centre, and are not only places of worship but the centre of tourism. Both of these Cathedrals started off as small church communities that, with the rise in demand, required a cathedral status. The main focus here will be the changes in spirituality within these spaces and the impact the alterations in layout and architecture has made to aspects of faith for the Christian members of the community.</p>

<p>Increasingly diverse demographics and a flourishing, powerful city created a need for larger, grander buildings of worship. St. Phillip’s church was designed by Thomas Archer and built in 1715 in the baroque style. It was named St Phillips after the Phillips family which originally owned the land it stands on. The main reason for the build was that the only nearby Anglican Church, St. Martins, could no longer cope with the huge rise in population. In 1660, there were approximately 6,000 people, but by 1732 it was estimated at closer to 15,000 (Birmingham Cathedral, 2015a). There are stories that a hill had risen from the dead because the church was running out of room for burials (Amos, L., Drummond, J. and Lamb, A. 1983, p. 3iii). When Charles Gore became bishop of the newly formed Birmingham diocese, he felt the need for a central cathedral. This is a direct consequence of Birmingham being declared a city in 1889, and the need to show its power, not just in industry and financially, but spiritually too. There was not enough money to create a brand new building however, so the old parish church was adapted by J. A. Chatwin, to construct a grander worshipping space, which was completed in 1905 (Pevsner Architectural Guides, 2009). St. Chads began its life as a small community of outlawed Catholics, which, after the reformation had decreased in numbers and its churches were destroyed or forcibly converted by Henry VIII. By 1829 however, persecution was decelerating and the Emancipation Act restored the Catholic rights (Hodgetts, M. 1990, p. 10). There was a popular Catholic chapel in Shadwell Street, but the growing demand meant that this building was no longer adequate to hold the population (Ward-Penny, C. 2004, p. 19). When plans were finally made to create a bigger building, St Chads became the first Roman Catholic cathedral to be built since the reformation, in 1839-41 (Groves, P. 1987, p. 33). It was specifically designed to contrast strongly with classical St Phillips (Hodgetts, M. 1987 p. 4). A significant change in growing communities forced both the Anglicans and Catholics to create new spaces for worship. </p>

<p>When St Phillips gained its cathedral status, the building required a bigger, more elaborate design. In anticipation of this, the church was extended to incorporate neo-classical pillars in the east end, a new high altar and a fuller, more majestic chancel (Dargue, W. 2012). These pillars were constructed to reflect the designs of Greece and Rome, as popular culture related the classical period with power and prosperity. In 1905 the ‘cathedra’ was added; the Bishop’s throne, signifying the change in status. Bishop Charles Gore would have sat in this chair for significant events, but it more of a feature now and is used only sparsely by the current Bishop of Birmingham; David Urquhart, installed in 2006. The canon’s stalls were also introduced. The altar was now further away from the lay people, but, unlike gothic cathedrals, there was no rood screen, so they could still view the service despite the added distance. This shows an inclusive space where all can be. It is important to note here, the way an upper gallery was included in the design. The upstairs was for practical reasons, as the church was very busy, but also to hold the choir. The focus was on hearing the word rather than the music, and those more privileged could sit closer to the altar downstairs while others remained above, peering down on the service. There was originally three galleries, although only two remain today (Birmingham Cathedral, 2015b). It represents a theology where the congregation was not as involved in the ceremony, and were simply bystanders. Originally, the pulpit of St Phillips was central, dominating the nave. This was a sign that the preacher was key, and all in the church were focused on their interpretation. After the changes were made to make the space into a cathedral, the pulpit was made smaller and pushed to the side. The main focus of the church was now on the central window, showing the ascension. This is an unusual theology for an Anglican church of this time, as usually there would be the nativity or crucifixion in its place. The organ was moved to the chancel, and the main focus was now on the music as well as the word of the priest (Amos, L., Drummond, J. and Lamb, A. 1983, 4ii-iv). For those who could not read and write, the way to worship was through music. These changes portray not just a change in space, but a change in spirituality.</p>

<p>As the “poor man’s Bible” the windows have a huge importance, and also show a change in ideology (Lehmberg, S. 2005, p. 64). The more extravagant design was integrated not just for decoration but as ways to help common people understand the significance of their faith. St Phillip’s originally had plain windows, but now house four of stained glass, which depict the Ascension 1885, the Nativity 1887, the Crucifixion 1887, and the Last Judgement 1895. Edward Burne-Jones, their designer, is well known for his “vibrancy, life-likeness and ability to tell a story” (Birmingham Cathedral, 2015c). At first, he was unimpressed by the building of St Phillips, saying “What a church is that of St. Phillips contemptible and shocking, only fit for a public library – into which they should turn it.” (MacCarthy, F. 2011, p. 471). This is a reflection on the plain interior by Thomas Archer styled partly to the Reformation period, which portrayed an idealism in Baroque meaning ‘bumpy misshapen pearls’. He was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites who wanted a vision of purity, of ‘truth to nature’ (Giebelhausen, M. 2012, p. 67). Therefore, Jesus as the main focus of the Christian faith came under “severe attack and dramatic revision” (Pelikan, J. 1999, p. 182). This originally culminated at the Council of Nicea in 325 in response to the Arian controversy, where it was argued that Jesus was the highest created being, but was not divine. This debate had gained ground again in the eighteenth century, “in this period of loose creeds the doctrine of Arianism gained ground, and the few among the nonconformists who held fast by the theology of their fathers, seceded from the various congregations and formed themselves into Independent churches” (Dent, R. 1880, p. 102). In the nativity window for example, the figure of Jesus is not glowing and central to the image as in most medieval icon art, but is a small and defenceless child to the bottom left. There was some concern that the Pre-Raphaelites were eroding His divine status by doing this (Giebelhausen, M. 2012, p. 69). However, this shift in religious thought was reflective of a time where Jesus was a significant figure still, but the focus was more on the historical story. Stemming from the enlightenment, there was a higher concentration on finding evidence for accrediting the bible, and so, many miracles were dropped as a result (Pelikan, J. 2014). The more realistic images were another example of this change in thought. These windows are the pinnacle of an otherwise plain building, but are not just decoration, they are full of meaning.</p>

<p>In St Chad’s Cathedral, the windows are more elaborate. Behind the altarpiece, Pugin’s stained glass windows shine an array of coloured light. This was specifically designed for the clergy rather than for the lay people and is of great detail (Cathedral Clergy, 1904, p. 156). Of particular note is the Immaculate Conception window in the West aisle. This is created in a more gothic style, with smaller images placed in rows of 3 by 6. Unlike St Phillips, which were designed as pictures to be manipulated into a window space by Morris, St Chads is designed to a typically gothic blueprint. It was created by John Hardman Powell (Pugin’s son-in-law) in 1868. It features scenes from the Old Testament in the left three columns, and from the New Testament in the right three (Hodgetts, M. 1987, p. 11). This shows a focus on the Bible in pictures so that the congregation could have a better idea of what was being preached. The windows are fundamental for the feeling of the church and reflect the change in ideology as the reformation’s influence came to a close. “Only in the 19th century was there a serious attempt to rediscover the techniques of the medieval glazier” (The Stained Glass Museum, 2015). The space continues to change. It shows the original intentions of the architect Pugin and how he wished for a Catholic Church which could flourish in detail and sacred art, which had been lost when the Anglican Church dominated the country.</p>

<p>As St Chad’s was built as a post-reformation cathedral, it contained features which were specifically designed to separate the congregation from the clergy. One example of this is the rood screen designed by Pugin. “Most Catholic Churches in the early nineteenth century were furnished sparsely. But Pugin was determined that his cathedral was not to be a mere shell” (Hodgetts, M. 1987, p. 5). Therefore the screen was elaborate, in the gothic style, with small saintly figures, and topped by a huge crucifix. This cross was the only part retained when the cathedral made changes in 1967, and so can be seen hanging above the sanctuary today. The rest of the rood screen was saved from a builder’s yard and now stands in Holy Trinity Church in Reading (Ward-Penny, C. 2004, p. 24). The changes to the cathedral were made because of the wish for a more open church where the laity were not so distanced from the clergy. This transformation in thought was due to the meetings of Vatican II. Catholic practise was renewed to reflect the historical significance of the church fathers, but also brought the faith into the modern era. In the ‘Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation’ document of 1965, for example, it is explained that the Catholic Church had fallen into a practise where “the Bible played a secondary role in the religious life of the faithful” and, “ecclesiastical authority narrowly restricted modern scriptural study” (Butler, C. 2015). By placing the altar far from the congregation and placing a rood screen as a barrier, the church restricted what lay people could see and take part in. The clergy was a greater influence than the Bible itself, and some felt that it was undermined by priests who portrayed their word as higher than the Book itself. The many meetings of this event concluded with new aims, including that the scripture and traditional practise must be part of a unity, and the preaching must be done in reference to the Bible in its approach. It also encourages Catholics to pick up the Bible for themselves in combination with the word of the preacher (Tanner, N. 2012, p. 83). This shift in theology means that the space is no longer divided into a place for the clergy and a place for onlookers, but a unified area for full worship of God. The sanctuary is still higher up to show its authority and contains much of Pugin’s work including the high altar, windows, and ceiling decoration, to create a grand, impressive space with a division from the simpler space below. It is changed in terms of how much it is viewed by the congregation, but is still kept as a special space left only for clergymen. In this way, St Chad’s was originally more exclusive because Pugin wanted to regain some of the essence of pre-reformation Catholic cathedrals which had been mostly destroyed and edited to reflect a simplistic ideology. However, it is now more of a space for all within the community, and becomes a more inviting place for believers of all statuses.</p>

<p>The bell tower on St Phillips was a part of the original church plan but was not added until 1725 because of a lack of funds. It dominates the skyline increasing the visibility of the church within the city. With it being on the top of the hill, this also ensures it towers even higher so that it is inviting from several directions. There are stories of arguments of status within a book from the 1880’s, where St Phillip’s purposefully brought more bells than the nearby church. They increased their number from 6 to 10, which beat St Martin’s 8 (Dent, R. 1880, p. 100). This church then fought back, installing 12 bells along two tiers in their bell tower. This shows the relationship between different spaces of worship as they tried to battle for dominance in Birmingham. The space of St Phillips church was not just for worship but was also a symbol of hierarchy as it tried to surpass all others in the area. The bell tower may be a calling card for believers, but also has prestigious connotations and holds meaning for the space. The act of bell ringing also went under change over the centuries leading up to and after the installation of St Phillips’ tower. In 1635 it was an act of the aristocracy as a way to keep fit and stimulate themselves intellectually. However, by the 1700’s, bell ringers were often “described as layouts and drunks” who did not even attend services (Discover Bell Ringing, no date). The bells were also said to have the power to heal and drive away the devil, hence why they began to be rung at funerals. This has changed over the centuries and the bells are now rung by men and women of all backgrounds. This shows a change in how the space is portrayed as a community task rather than a job for the select few. The space has changed due to culture and the fight for dominance, as well as trying to encourage the spiritual nature of Christians.</p>

<p>St Edward’s chapel is a space of different spiritual significance within the cathedral of St. Chad’s. It was consecrated in 1933 and represents a change in setting from the huge nave of the cathedral (Doolan, B. no date). It is noted by Hodgetts that it is the only distraction from an otherwise straight view up to the altar (Hodgetts, M. 1987, p. 8). This is significant because Pugin’s idea for a large space pointing towards the main focus is changed when this addition is made. There is now something to distract the eye as they enter the Cathedral. Inside the chapel there are few seats, showing that this chapel is more personal and not made to hold large services. This means that the attention of the individual is on themselves and their spiritual feelings as they pray, rather than the large service which is going on in the main sanctuary. It was also built to add a confessional rail “to alleviate Pugin’s inadequate provision” (O’Donnell, R. 2002, p. 62). This space is therefore used as a place of reflection too, as each person is required to think about what they have done wrong and how it impacts on their faith. The chapel also contained the bone of St Chad, whereas the rest are kept at the altar. This is of significance because of the importance of relics. They first lay within Lichfield cathedral, but were removed at the time of the Reformation to ensure their safety. The bones were hidden by the Hodgett’s family, passed on to Peter Marshall (Turner) and somehow ended up in a box under the altar at Aston Hall, before moving to their permanent home in the new Cathedral in 1841. This process is documented in the windows of the Chapel (Hodgetts, M. 1987, p. 10). They were originally believed to be real bones of the saint, but more recent radiocarbon dating identified that there were 5 bones, of at least two individuals, and there was no guarantee that any were of the Saint himself (Greenslade, M. 2009, p. 28). However, relics hold a place in tradition for pilgrimage, so that one may be healed or blessed by getting a glimpse of or even touching a relic, something that was slowly decreasing but still practised after the flourish of the late fifteenth century (McGrath, 2012, p. 24). They hold a spiritual power which is confirmed through the bone in this small area. Before the reformation, there was concern that they were being sold as indulgences and that this poisoned the church. However they remain a part of St Chad’s belief system. St Edward’s Chapel represents a new space within the Cathedral which is used to enhance personal spiritual reflection. </p>

<p>The space is also used for remembrance. During the Second World War, both cathedrals were damaged. For St Phillip’s, it meant a completely new roof and most of the stone work had to be replaced (Pevsner Architectural Guides, 2009). At St Chad’s an incendiary bomb fell through the ceiling and exploded, but on entry it bounced off the newly fitted central heating. The pipes burst and the resulting flood put out the flames of the bomb, saving the cathedral (Hodgetts, M. 1987, p. 21). In the south aisle there is one panel in the ceiling marked ‘Deo Gratias, Nov 22, 1940’, representing the date of the incident. After the world wars especially, the church becomes a space for memory and reflection, as the focus changes to loss. This is shown physically by a window in the same aisle by Hardman’s, showing the men who died in the First World War. This aisle also features memorials to the Archbishop Thomas Leighton Williams in the form of a tablet, and to George Wareing, who died in the cathedral in 1844; a window from his wife (Doolan, B. no date, p. 7). In St Phillips, there is a memorial to the First World War installed in 1920 by A S Dixon, and in the West end there are several flags, showing the cathedral’s strong affiliation with the armed forces from past to present. Both cathedrals may be scarred by war, but the spiritual act of remembrance is an essential part of the use of these buildings.</p>

<p>In conclusion, both spaces within St Chad’s and St Phillip’s Cathedral have changed over time spiritually and physically. The significance of a simple alteration such as moving the altar closer to the nave is huge. The Anglican and Catholic Church have shown in these two Birmingham examples that they now embrace an inclusive, mixed service for both the laity and the clergy.Personal spirituality is changed depending on where in the Cathedrals one is stood. St Phillip’s and St Chad’s Cathedrals feature places for remembrance, worship, status, education, and most of all the Christian life. Today, they are a major part of the community and their place in the centre of Birmingham highlights their importance to the city as well as to the Christian faith.</p>
